# ZOOM 
(Car Inventory App)

# Description:
A app that allows users to store the vehicles that come into the shop for inventory and organization. The user can log each vehicle into the system and sort the vehicles by status. "WIP" (work in progress) which are cars that need to be repaired. "DONE/ READY TO SELL" (completed vehicles) cars that are done with repairs and have gone through a road test & ready to be sold to a customer.

# Task
Back-end tasks was setting up server routes to render content.

# Users
The app is designed mainly for dealerships or mechanic shops that want to keep an inventory of their vehicles that come in from public auctions and have to be repaired.

# Benefit

The app will allow shops to not only stay organized, but it gives them a system to stay on track of all of their cars. 

# Future Development

The future development would be to add user authentication so each user can access their own private account and create and view their inventory. With ZOOM the user will be able to sort the cars by make/ model/ year, status (WIP) (R2S) or alphabetical order. It will display on an individual page with the image of the actual vehicle and provide information on what was repaired, VIN and other important car information. There's nothing we would take away, we would just build on and add to the app to make improvements
