# VROOM 
(Car Inventory App)

# Description:
A app that allows users to store the vehicles that come into the shop for inventory and organization. The user can log each vehicle into the system and sort the vehicles by status. "WIP" (work in progress) which are cars that need to be repaired. "DONE/ READY TO SELL" (completed vehicles) cars that are done with repairs and have gone through a road test & ready to be sold to a customer.

# Users
The app is designed mainly for dealerships or mechanic shops that want to keep an inventory of their vehicles that come in from public auctions and have to be repaired.

# Benefit

The app will allow shops to not only stay organized, but it gives them a system to stay on track of all of their cars. 

# Future Development

With VROOM the user will be able to sort the cars by make/ model/ year or status (WIP) (R2S). It will also display the image of the actual vehicle and provide information on what was repaired.
